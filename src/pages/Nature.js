        		<div>	Nature photography is a wide range of photography taken outdoors and devoted to displaying natural elements such as 
			            landscapes, wildlife, plants, and close-ups of natural scenes and textures. Nature photography tends to put a stronger 
			            emphasis on the aesthetic value of the photo than other photography genres, such as photojournalism and documentary 
			            photography. [1]
						Nature photography overlaps the fields of -- and is sometimes considered an overarching category including -- 
						wildlife photography, landscape photography, and garden photography.
						Nature photographs are published in scientific, travel and cultural magazines such as National Geographic Magazine, 
						National Wildlife Magazine and Audubon Magazine or other more specific magazines such as Outdoor Photographer and Nature`s 
						Best Photography. Well known nature photographers include Frans Lanting, Galen Rowell, Mark Gray, Eliot Porter and Art Wolfe.
