				Aerial photography is the taking of photographs from an aircraft or other flying object.[1] Platforms for aerial 
	            photography include fixed-wing aircraft, helicopters, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs or "drones"), balloons, blimps and 
	            dirigibles, rockets, pigeons, kites, parachutes, stand-alone telescoping and vehicle-mounted poles. Mounted cameras may be 
	            triggered remotely or automatically; hand-held photographs may be taken by a photographer.

				Aerial photography should not be confused with air-to-air photography, where one or more aircraft are used as chase planes 
				that chase and photograph other aircraft in flight.
